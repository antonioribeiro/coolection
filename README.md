Access your collection items as properties:

``` php
$collection->name

$collection->addresses->first()->street_name

$collection->flatten()->cars->filter(function($car) { return $car->name == 'ferrari' })->last()->model

$countries->where('name.common', 'United States')->first()->currency->name->english;
```

## Why?

Answering with a question: which one is easier to look at?

``` php
collect(
    collect(
        collect(
            collect(
                $collection['cars']
            )->unique('constructor')['models']
        )->last()['model']
    )['colors']
)->first()['rgb']
```

or

``` php
$collection->cars->unique('constructor')->last()->model->colors->first()->rgb
```

So you can write this:

``` php
collect($vimeo)->body->data->first()->metadata->connections->likes->total;
```

Instead of

``` php
collect($vimeo)['body']['data'][0]['metadata']['connections']['likes']['total'];
```

## PHP Agnostic

This is an agnostic PHP package, which uses an extracted version of Laravel's Illuminate Collection, it's actually [tightenco/collect](https://github.com/tightenco/collect), modified to access collection items as properties.

## Documentation

It's Laravel's Collection, at full power, you can check [its docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/collections). The only difference is that you can access items (array keys) as properties, like any other PHP object:

``` php
$collection->map($mapper)->reduce($reducer)->random()->address->street

$this->sendThanks(
    $collection->where('full_name', 'Barack Obama')->addresses->random()
);    

$countries->where('name.common', 'United States')->first()->currency->symbol;
```

## Changes to [tightenco/collect](https://github.com/tightenco/collect)

As it is still using [Illuminate's namespace](https://github.com/tightenco/collect/pull/56), which will conflict with **Illuminate\Support\Collection**, for those who need to use it in a Laravel project, this package has an [updater script](upgrade-collect.sh) which downloads tightenco/collect sources and change the namespace to [**Tightenco\Collect**](https://github.com/antonioribeiro/coolection/blob/master/src/package/Support/Tightenco/Collect/src/Tightenco/Collect/Support/Collection.php).  

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require pragmarx/coollection
```

## Usage

Instantiate, the class directly or using the helper:

``` php
$c = new Coollection(['first_name' => 'Barack Obama']);

$c = coollect(['first_name' => 'Barack Obama']);
``` 

Then you use it as an object:

``` php
echo $c->first_name;

// Barack Obama


echo $c->flip()->barak_obama == 'first_name' 
    ? 'true' 
    : 'false';

// true
```
